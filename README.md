# Airbnb Data Analysis

## Introduction
This project provides an in-depth analysis of Airbnb listings, focusing on various factors such as prices, room types, neighborhoods, and reviews. The aim is to understand how these factors influence the Airbnb rental market and to identify key trends.

## 1. Distribution of Listing Prices by Neighbourhood
**Objective:** Visualize how rental prices are distributed across different neighborhoods.

- **Price Variation:** Rental prices vary widely across neighborhoods.
- **High-Priced Areas:** Central neighborhoods like Midtown and Harlem in Manhattan have the highest average prices due to their prime locations.
- **Moderately Priced Areas:** Neighborhoods slightly away from the city center, such as East Harlem and parts of Brooklyn, have moderate prices.
- **Lower-Priced Areas:** Suburban neighborhoods tend to have lower prices, attracting budget-conscious travelers.
- **Factors Influencing Prices:** Proximity to attractions and transportation, safety, and neighborhood popularity.

## 2. Count of Listings by Room Type
**Objective:** Determine the distribution of listings across different room types.

- **Findings:** 
  - The majority of listings are entire homes or apartments.
  - Private rooms are the second most common.
  - Shared rooms make up a small percentage of the total listings.

## 3. Average Price by Neighbourhood Group
**Objective:** Analyze how the average price varies across different neighbourhood groups.

- **Manhattan:** Highest average prices due to central location, high demand, and luxury accommodations.
- **Brooklyn:** Wide range of prices, with higher costs in trendy areas and more affordable options in residential neighborhoods.
- **Queens:** Moderate prices, balancing affordability and proximity to Manhattan.
- **Bronx:** Generally the most affordable listings, reflecting its residential nature.
- **Staten Island:** Lower prices, likely due to geographical separation and lesser-known status among tourists.

## 4. Room Type Analysis
**Objective:** Understand the distribution of different room types.

- **Findings:**
  - **Entire Home/Apt:** The majority of listings, indicating a strong preference for private accommodations.
  - **Private Room:** Also common, offering a balance between privacy and affordability.
  - **Shared Room:** A very small percentage of listings, appealing mainly to budget-conscious travelers.
  - **Hotel Room:** Almost no listings, indicating that hotels rarely use Airbnb to reach potential guests.

## 5. Average Price by Room Type
**Objective:** Compare average prices for different room types.

- **Findings:**
  - **Entire Home/Apt:** Highest average prices, reflecting the value of having the entire space to oneself.
  - **Private Room:** Moderately priced, offering a balance of privacy and affordability.
  - **Shared Room:** Lowest prices, catering to budget-conscious travelers.
  - **Hotel Room:** Prices vary but are generally lower than entire homes, likely due to competition and differing service levels.

## 6. Number of Reviews by Room Type
**Objective:** Analyze how the number of reviews varies with room types.

- **Findings:**
  - **Entire Home/Apt:** Typically receives a higher number of reviews, suggesting they are popular and often booked.
  - **Private Room:** Also attracts a significant number of reviews, indicating a good balance between popularity and privacy.
  - **Shared Room:** Fewer reviews, possibly reflecting its lower popularity due to less privacy.
  - **Hotel Room:** Number of reviews varies, generally comparable to private rooms, indicating that hotels also maintain a substantial presence on the platform.

## 7. Number of Reviews vs. Price
**Objective:** Explore the relationship between the number of reviews and listing prices.

- **Findings:**
  - **Positive Correlation:** Listings with higher prices tend to receive more reviews, suggesting higher-priced properties may attract more guests or generate higher demand.
  - **Outliers:** Some high-priced listings have fewer reviews, indicating they might not be as highly booked despite the higher price.
  - **Budget Listings:** Cheaper properties generally have fewer reviews, which could reflect lower booking frequency or less guest engagement.
