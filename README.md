Title: Airbnb Data Analysis

Introduction
This report provides an analysis of Airbnb listings using data on prices, room types, neighbourhoods, and reviews. The aim is to understand the distribution of listing prices by neighbourhood, the count of listings by room type, and various other factors that influence the Airbnb rental market.

1. Distribution of Listing Prices by Neighbourhood
Objective: To visualize how rental prices are distributed across different neighbourhoods.

Price Variation: Rental prices vary widely across neighborhoods.
High-Priced Areas: Central neighborhoods like Midtown and Harlem in Manhattan have the highest average prices due to their prime locations.
Moderately Priced Areas: Neighborhoods slightly away from the city center, such as East Harlem and parts of Brooklyn, have moderate prices.
Lower-Priced Areas: Suburban neighborhoods tend to have lower prices, attracting budget-conscious travelers.
Factors: Proximity to attractions and transportation, safety, and neighborhood popularity influence rental prices. 

2. Count of Listings by Room Type
Objective: To determine the distribution of listings across different room types.

Findings: The majority of listings are entire homes or apartments, followed by private rooms. Shared rooms constitute a small percentage of the total.

3. Average Price by Neighbourhood Group
Objective: To analyze how the average price varies across different neighbourhood groups.

Findings:
Manhattan: Highest average prices due to central location, high demand, and luxury accommodations.
Brooklyn: Wide range of prices, with higher costs in trendy areas and more affordable options in residential neighborhoods.
Queens: Moderate prices, balancing affordability and proximity to Manhattan.
Bronx: Generally the most affordable listings, reflecting its residential nature.
Staten Island: Lower prices, likely due to its geographical separation and lesser-known status among tourists. 

4. Room Type Analysis
Objective: To understand the distribution of different room types.

Findings:
Entire Home/Apt: The majority of listings, indicating a strong preference for private accommodations where guests have the entire place to themselves.
Private Room: Also common, showing that many hosts offer private rooms within their homes, providing a balance between privacy and affordability.
Shared Room: A very small percentage of listings, appealing mainly to budget travelers due to the lack of privacy.
Hotel Room: Almost no listings, indicating hotels rarely use Airbnb to reach potential guests.

5. Average Price by Room Type
Objective: To compare average prices for different room types.

Findings:
Entire Home/Apt: Highest average prices, reflecting the value of having the whole space to oneself.
Private Room: Moderately priced, offering a balance of privacy and affordability.
Shared Room: Lowest prices, catering to budget-conscious travelers.
Hotel Room: Prices vary, but are generally lower than entire homes, likely due to competition and differing service levels.

6. Number of Reviews by Room Type
Objective: To analyze how the number of reviews varies with room types.

Findings:
Entire Home/Apt: Typically receives a higher number of reviews, suggesting they are popular and often booked.
Private Room: Also attracts a significant number of reviews, indicating a good balance between popularity and privacy.
Shared Room: Fewer reviews, which may reflect its lower popularity due to less privacy.
Hotel Room: Number of reviews varies, but generally comparable to private rooms, indicating that hotels also maintain a substantial presence on the platform.

7. Number of Reviews vs. Price
Objective: To explore the relationship between the number of reviews and listing prices.

Findings: 
Positive Correlation: Listings with higher prices tend to receive more reviews, suggesting that higher-priced properties may attract more guests or generate higher demand.
Outliers: Some high-priced listings may have fewer reviews, indicating that while they are expensive, they might not always be highly booked.
Budget Listings: Cheaper properties generally have fewer reviews, which could reflect lower booking frequency or less guest engagement.
